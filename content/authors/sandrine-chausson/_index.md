I'm a first year PhD student at the UKRI Centre for Doctoral Training in Natural Language Processing at the University of Edinburgh working under the supervision of Bj√∂rn Ross and Nadin Kokciyan. My research focuses on analysing the evolution of the environmental discourse over the last few decades using techniques from NLP.
