I am a PhD student at the School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh, where I am currently researching sarcasm and other types of non-literal meanings in Persian. My work is conducted under the supervision of Dr. Walid Magdy and Prof. Bonnie Webber. Before joining Edinburgh, I focused on diverse aspects of text understanding at Shiraz University, Iran.
