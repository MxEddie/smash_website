abstract: Online social networks provide an environment for their users to share content
  with others, where the user who shares a content item is put in charge, generally
  ignoring others that might be affected by it. However, a content that is shared
  by one user can very well violate the privacy of other users. To remedy this, ideally,
  all users who are related to a content should get a say in how the content should
  be shared. Recent approaches advocate the use of agreement technologies to enable
  stakeholders of a post to discuss the privacy configurations of a post. This allows
  related individuals to express concerns so that various privacy violations are avoided
  up front. Existing techniques try to establish an agreement on a single post. However,
  most of the time, agreement should be established over multiple posts such that
  the user can tolerate slight breaches of privacy in return of a right to share posts
  themselves in future interactions. As a result, users can help each other preserve
  their privacy, viewing this as their social responsibility. This article develops
  a reciprocity-based negotiation for reaching privacy agreements among users and
  introduces a negotiation architecture that combines semantic privacy rules with
  utility functions. We evaluate our approach over multiagent simulations with software
  agents that mimic users based on a user study.
