abstract: 'Influence maximisation, or how to affect the intrinsic opinion dynamics
  of a social group, is relevant for many applications, such as information campaigns,
  political competition, or marketing. Previous literature on influence maximisation
  has mostly explored discrete allocations of influence, i.e. optimally choosing a
  finite fixed number of nodes to target. Here, we study the generalised problem of
  continuous influence maximisation where nodes can be targeted with flexible intensity.
  We focus on optimal influence allocations against a passive opponent and compare
  the structure of the solutions in the continuous and discrete regimes. We find that,
  whereas hub allocations play a central role in explaining optimal allocations in
  the discrete regime, their explanatory power is strongly reduced in the continuous
  regime. Instead, we find that optimal continuous strategies are very well described
  by two other patterns: (i) targeting the same nodes as the opponent (shadowing)
  and (ii) targeting direct neighbours of the opponent (shielding). Finally, we investigate
  the game-theoretic scenario of two active opponents and show that the unique pure
  Nash equilibrium is to target all nodes equally. These results expose fundamental
  differences in the solutions to discrete and continuous regimes and provide novel
  effective heuristics for continuous influence maximisation.'
