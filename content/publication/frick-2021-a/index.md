abstract: "Organizations are collecting large amounts of data that are generated by Internet-connected devices in people's homes. This raises questions regarding online privacy and data security. A common concern is that online advertisements are personalized based on conversations that have unknowingly been recorded by people's smart devices. The present article examines this phenomenon and the potential determinants influencing this concern. For this purpose, an online survey (N = 277) was conducted. Three predictors were identified that affect the perceived surveillance of conversations: trust in smart devices, computer anxiety and prior negative experience. The developed surveillance effect model is discussed to understand the factors influencing this concern. The findings of this study serve as a foundation for future research and might support organizations in optimizing customer relations."
