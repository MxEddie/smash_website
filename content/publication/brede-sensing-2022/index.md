abstract: Sensing and processing information from dynamically changing environments
  is essential for the survival of animal collectives and the functioning of human
  society. In this context, previous work has shown that communication between networked
  agents with some preference towards adopting the majority opinion can enhance the
  quality of error-prone individual sensing from dynamic environments. In this paper,
  we compare the potential of different types of complex networks for such sensing
  enhancement. Numerical simulations on complex networks are complemented by a mean-field
  approach for limited connectivity that captures essential trends in dependencies.
  Our results show that, whilst bestowing advantages on a small group of agents, degree
  heterogeneity tends to impede overall sensing enhancement. In contrast, clustering
  and spatial structure play a more nuanced role depending on overall connectivity.
  We find that ring graphs exhibit superior enhancement for large connectivity and
  that random graphs outperform for small connectivity. Further exploring the role
  of clustering and path lengths in small-world models, we find that sensing enhancement
  tends to be boosted in the small-world regime.
