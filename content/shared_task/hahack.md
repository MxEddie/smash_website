<h1><b> Task 7: Hahackathon: Linking Humor and Offense Across Different Age Groups </b></h1>

<h2><b>Background and Motivation</b></h2>
Humor, like most figurative language, poses interesting linguistic challenges to NLP, due to its emphasis on multiple word senses, cultural knowledge, and pragmatic competence.  Humor appreciation is also a highly subjective phenomenon, with age, gender and socio-economic status known to have an impact on the perception of a joke. In this task, we collected labels and ratings from a balanced set of age groups from 18-70. Our annotators also represented a variety of genders, political stances and income levels.

<b><h2>Tasks</b></h2>
* Task 1 emulates previous humor detection tasks in which all ratings were averaged to provide mean classification and rating scores. 

    * Task 1a: predict if the text would be considered humorous (for an average user). This is a binary task.
    * Task 1b: if the text is classed as humorous, predict how humorous it is (for an average user). The values vary between 0 and 5.
    * Task 1c: if the text is classed as humorous, predict if the humor rating would be considered controversial, i.e. the variance of the rating between annotators is higher than the median. This is a binary task.


* Task 2 aims to predict how offensive a text would be (for an average user) with values between 0 and 5. 
     * Task 2a: predict how generally offensive a text is for users. This score was calculated regardless of whether the text is classed as humorous or offensive overall.
